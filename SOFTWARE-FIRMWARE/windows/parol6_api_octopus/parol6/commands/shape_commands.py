    A SystemCommand (like SELECT_PROFILE): safety configuration applies
    immediately at intake — never enabled-gated, never queued behind (or
    dropped with) motion. The controller mirrors the applied shapes to the
    planner subprocess via ``sync_shapes`` after this executes.

    A world change also invalidates committed motion that now violates it
    (MoveIt-style): the segment player re-guards the streaming trajectory's
    remaining waypoints on the version bump, and every trajectory again at
    activation, halting with the collision error instead of driving into the
    new keep-out.

    This is the codec boundary: the wire form is rebuilt into waldoctl
    ``Shape`` objects here (running their construction-time validation), and
    everything downstream — state, checkers, subprocess syncs, readback —
    speaks ``Shape`` only.
