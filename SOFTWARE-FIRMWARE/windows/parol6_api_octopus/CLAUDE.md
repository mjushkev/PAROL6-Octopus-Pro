# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PAROL6 Python API is a lightweight client and controller for PAROL6 6-DOF robot arms. It provides:
- **AsyncRobotClient**: Async UDP client for robot control
- **RobotClient**: Synchronous wrapper for imperative scripts
- **Controller**: Fixed-rate control loop with serial/simulator transport

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Development setup
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install

# Linting & formatting
ruff check .
ruff format .
ty check parol6/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run -a

# Testing (simulator used by default via conftest.py — do NOT prefix with env vars)
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_wire.py -v
```

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT prefix `pytest` commands with environment variables like `PAROL6_FAKE_SERIAL=1 pytest ...`. The conftest.py already configures `PAROL6_FAKE_SERIAL=1`. Just run `pytest` directly.**

## Controller CLI

```bash
# Start controller
parol6-server --log-level=INFO

# With explicit serial port
parol6-server --serial=/dev/ttyUSB0 --log-level=DEBUG

# Verbosity shortcuts: -v (INFO), -vv (DEBUG), -vvv (TRACE)
```

## Key Modules

- **`parol6/client/async_client.py`**: Primary API - async UDP client with motion commands, queries, and status streaming
- **`parol6/server/controller.py`**: Controller with fixed-rate loop and command execution
- **`parol6/commands/`**: Polymorphic command classes using `@register_command(CmdType.XXX)` decorator
- **`parol6/protocol/wire.py`**: Msgpack message encoding/decoding, command structs (tagged union)
- **`parol6/PAROL6_ROBOT.py`**: Robot kinematics config, DH parameters, joint limits, tool transforms

## Adding a New Command

1. Create a class in `parol6/commands/` and decorate with `@register_command(CmdType.YOUR_CMD)`
2. Define a `PARAMS_TYPE` msgspec Struct for wire validation
3. Implement `do_setup(state)` and `execute_step(state)` lifecycle methods
4. For motion commands, set `streamable=True` if supporting high-rate streaming

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PAROL6_CONTROL_RATE_HZ` | 100 | Control loop frequency |
| `PAROL6_STATUS_RATE_HZ` | 50 | Status broadcast rate (tests use 20 Hz) |
| `PAROL6_FAKE_SERIAL` | 0 | Enable simulator (no hardware) |
| `PAROL6_COM_PORT` | auto | Serial port override |
| `PAROL_TRACE` | 0 | Enable TRACE logging |

## Simulator Mode

- Uses `MockSerialTransport` to emulate robot dynamics without hardware
- Toggle via client: `simulator(True)` / `simulator(False)`
- Controller updates `PAROL6_FAKE_SERIAL` and reinitializes transport seamlessly
- **Important**: Simulator cannot guarantee hardware success—motor/current limits may cause failures on real robot

## Kinematics Notes

- Uses numerical IK via pinokin (C++/Pinocchio with nanobind Python bindings)
- J4 is particularly sensitive—some cartesian targets may fail to solve
- Update `PAROL6_ROBOT.py` for modified hardware (gear ratios, limits, DH params)

## Test Markers

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Isolated component tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Component interaction tests (uses simulator)

## Performance Warnings

If you see `Control loop avg period degraded by +XX%`:
- Reduce `PAROL6_CONTROL_RATE_HZ`
- Disable TRACE logging (significant overhead)
- Avoid heavy background tasks during motion

## Hot Path Rules

`execute_step()` and `tick()` run at 100 Hz. **No heap allocations** in these methods.

For streamable commands (`streamable = True`), `do_setup()` also runs at high frequency (50 Hz from UI) via `assign_params()` + `do_setup()` fast-path. Treat it as a hot path too.

- No `list(...)`, `[x for x in ...]`, `dict(...)`, or other container construction
- No string formatting or f-strings (except in error/stop paths that run once)
- Pre-allocate all buffers in `__init__`
- `ndarray[:] = list` is fine — numpy writes into existing buffer in-place
- Use `dest[:] = src` for array copies. Only use `np.copyto(dest, src, casting=...)` when casting is needed — it's slower otherwise

## Code Style

- **Comments**: Describe the final code state, not what changed. Avoid "changed X to Y" or "added this because..." comments.
- **Never ship declared-but-unimplemented API surface.** No "reserved" fields or params, no docstrings saying "not yet applied" — implement it or don't declare it.
- **Type annotations**: Fix type errors properly instead of using `# type: ignore`. Prefer:
  - `@overload` decorators for functions with different return types based on input
  - `assert` statements to narrow types after None checks
  - `cast()` from typing when the type is known but the checker can't infer it
  - `np.atleast_1d()` or similar to guarantee array returns from numpy functions
  - Only use `# type: ignore` as a last resort for genuine type checker limitations (e.g., numpy's `ArrayLike` being too broad)

## Testing Guidelines

**When CI tests fail, fix them.** Don't waste time analyzing whether failures are "related to your changes" — just fix all failing tests. The goal is a green CI, not attribution.

Prefer fewer, comprehensive integration tests that mimic manual testing over a large number of unit tests. We have no code coverage requirements—the goal is working features, not metrics.
- **No tautological tests.** Assert behavior, not what's true by construction — not default fields, constructor args echoed back, enum literals, `isinstance`/frozen-raises, or stub-raises-`NotImplementedError`. Drive a method/workflow and assert the outcome.
- **Test results are in `test-results.xml`.** Pytest writes JUnit XML to `test-results.xml` automatically. When diagnosing failures, read this file — it contains test names, durations, failure messages, and captured output. This is more reliable than parsing console output.
- **NEVER run parol6 and web commander test suites in parallel** — no proper isolation, they share resources and have timing issues when resource-constrained. Always run sequentially.
- **NEVER allow subagents to run tests.** Many tests are timing-sensitive and the system doesn't have enough resources for agents and tests to run simultaneously. Only the main conversation should run tests, and only after all agents have completed.

### No testing theatre

- Default to real components (fake-serial controller, simulator). A hand-rolled fake is a last resort.
- Never fake a contract you haven't read — match the real code's raise-vs-return behavior, return types/codes, and signatures.
- If a fake must mimic protocol behavior (acks, return codes, ordering, lifecycle), the test is at the wrong layer — use the real path. Fakes are for one-line oracles only (e.g. a distance function feeding gate-logic tests).
- Enter through the real path (command dispatch / client call), not internal helpers fed hand-built inputs.
- Derive cases from the requirement, not the code under test — "rejects invalid input" means NaN/inf/negative/zero, not the cases the code already handles.
- Assert outcomes, not interactions — "the fake was called" proves nothing.
- A regression test must fail against the bug before the fix. Born-green regression tests are theatre.
