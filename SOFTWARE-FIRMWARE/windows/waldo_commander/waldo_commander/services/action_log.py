"""Action-log dedup service — feeds ``commander.status.action``.

Action state lives on ``commander.status.action`` (``history``, ``state``,
``current_name``). This service holds the per-session bookkeeping needed to
coalesce repeated commands and detect command transitions from the raw
``StatusBuffer`` fields.

``process_status`` is called from the status consumer once per tick; on any
change it reassigns ``commander.status.action.history`` wholesale and calls
``Action.notify_changed()`` so the readout panel's change listener rebuilds
its HTML. (Nothing value-binds ``Action.history``; the listener is what drives
the refresh.)
