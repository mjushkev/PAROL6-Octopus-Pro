"""WC-side concrete ``ProgramTabs`` — provides the open/new/close/switch
methods that ``waldoctl.ProgramTabs`` declares as ``NotImplementedError``,
plus helpers for session-wide recording state.

The base ``ProgramTabs`` defines the public observation surface (``items``,
``active_id``, ``active`` / ``get`` / ``find_by_path`` lookups) and the
mutate-in-place invariant. WC owns the action verbs: opening files from
disk, creating new buffers, closing tabs, and switching the active tab.

Programs created here use waldoctl's ``Program`` directly — disk
persistence and reload still live in WC's editor component (file_operations
mediates the actual I/O), so the host application never calls
``program.save()`` / ``program.reload()`` (those remain
``NotImplementedError`` until a future PR moves the I/O into the API).
