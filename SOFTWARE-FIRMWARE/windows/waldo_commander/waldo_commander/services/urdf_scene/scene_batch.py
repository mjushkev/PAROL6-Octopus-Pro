"""Coalesce ``scene.run_method`` calls into a single WS frame.

NiceGUI's ``Object3D.move/rotate/scale/material/...`` each emit a separate
``run_method`` → ``run_javascript`` → outbox message → WS frame. When many
of these fire in one Python tick (e.g. 6 joints × move+rotate per call to
``UrdfScene.set_axis_values``), three.js can render frames with only a
subset applied, producing visible "shake" while the wrist sits in a
partially-updated pose.

The ``batch_scene`` context manager temporarily redirects ``scene.run_method``
to a queue, then on exit flushes the queue as one ``run_javascript`` that
loops through ``runMethod(scene_id, name, args)`` synchronously. The browser
applies the full batch before its next render — atomic visual update.

Inside the block, all Object3D state updates (``self.x``, ``self.R``, etc.)
still happen normally because they're set *before* ``_move()``/``_rotate()``
calls into the patched ``run_method``. We don't touch Object3D internals.

Constraints:
    * Batched calls are fire-and-forget. Awaiting one inside the block
      raises — see ``BatchedAwaitError``.
    * Nested ``batch_scene`` blocks are flat: the outermost block is the
      one that flushes.

    Yields:
        Nothing — the block body runs unmodified; the flush happens on exit.

    Example:
        >>> with batch_scene(self.scene):

        another task observe the patched ``scene.run_method`` and the
