"""``commander.scene`` implementation over the core ``UrdfScene``.

Lets plugins draw into named, plugin-owned groups of the shared 3D scene. The
scene is created per page (and may not exist yet), so the handle resolves
``ui_state.urdf_scene`` lazily on each call and no-ops when there is no live
scene. Each ``overlay`` deletes the group's prior contents and re-adds inside a
``batch_scene`` so updates apply atomically.
