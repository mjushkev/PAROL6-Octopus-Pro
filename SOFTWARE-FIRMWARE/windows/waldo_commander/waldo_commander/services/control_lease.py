"""Single-controller arbitration across browser tabs and MCP sessions.

Exactly one holder may issue actuation commands at a time; everyone else
observes (reads are never gated), and the holder is always visible so nobody
*unknowingly* drives the arm. The default holder is the active browser tab; an
MCP session seizes control with the ``control.take_control`` tool. Anyone may
seize — visibility, not permission, is what prevents unknowing dual control.

Liveness:
- a ``browser`` holder is live while its client id is in nicegui's
  ``Client.instances`` (same registry the multi-tab arbitration uses);
- an ``mcp`` holder is live while its last gated call was within
  :data:`MCP_TTL_SECONDS` — MCP has no per-connection registry on this side, so
  the holder refreshes a timestamp on every gated call and a crashed/disconnected
  session ages out.

A stale holder is dropped on the next query, so anyone can reclaim it. This is
host-application policy (the MCP server runs in WC's process and shares this
state), not part of the public ``commander`` surface.
