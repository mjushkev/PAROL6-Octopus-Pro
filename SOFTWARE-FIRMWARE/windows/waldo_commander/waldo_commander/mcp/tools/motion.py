"""MCP tools for direct motion commands — ``commander.client.*``.

Every **actuating** tool here passes :func:`require_actuation` with a short
human description — the single-controller lease plus mode-dependent approval
(per-action in Inspect/Auto-edits; auto in Autopilot, with a one-time hardware
consent floor). The deliberately ungated tools are ``halt`` (stopping is always
safe) and ``wait_motion`` (passive).

These wrappers are deliberately a flat subset of the full client surface: the
most common motion verbs an LLM is likely to issue, for single ad-hoc nudges.
Prefer building any multi-step sequence as a visible program via
``programs.propose_edit`` + ``execution.run_active`` — the human can then
preview and scrub the path. Advanced moves (``move_c``, ``move_s``, ``move_p``,
servo modes) are intentionally not exposed for v1 for the same reason.
