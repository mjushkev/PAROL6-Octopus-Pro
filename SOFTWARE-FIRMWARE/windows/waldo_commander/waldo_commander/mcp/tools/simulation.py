"""MCP tools mirroring WC's GUI simulator + playback controls — ``simulation.*``.

These expose the same operations as the GUI's robot/sim toggle and the bottom
playback bar's play/pause/step buttons, so an LLM can drive the simulator and
preview timeline exactly as a human would. ``set_simulator`` is a backend-only
mode switch; ``play_pause`` / ``step`` reuse the playback controller and run in
the live page's client context so any scrub-bar updates land on the browser.
