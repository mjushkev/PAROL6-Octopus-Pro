"""PLC-style I/O cycle: wait for a start input, run the moves, signal at-home.

The classic cell handshake (WAIT DI / set DO on a teach pendant) written as
a program, so no GUI configuration is needed:
  1. Park at the home/standby pose and raise Output 2 ("robot at home").
  2. Block until Input 1 goes high (wire it to a PLC output or a button).
  3. Drop Output 2 and run one cycle of moves.
  4. Repeat CYCLES times; use `while True:` for a free-running cell (the
     editor preview only renders programs that finish).
